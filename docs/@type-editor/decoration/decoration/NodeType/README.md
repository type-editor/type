Node decoration type that applies styling or attributes to an entire
node in the document. Node decorations span exactly one node.

Node decorations are used to add styling or attributes to block-level
nodes, such as highlighting an entire paragraph, marking a code block
as having an error, or adding a visual indicator to a selected table cell.
They wrap the entire node's DOM representation.
