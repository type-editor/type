Widget decoration type that represents a DOM node inserted at a specific
position in the document. Widgets appear at a single position and don't
span a range.

Widgets are useful for adding inline UI elements like mention suggestions,
inline buttons, or custom markers that don't correspond to actual document
content. The widget's DOM node is inserted into the editor at the specified
position without affecting the document model.
