Public interface for editor selections.
This is the main interface that external code interacts with,
typically through the EditorSelection class which implements it.

Selections represent the current user selection or cursor position
in the editor. They can be text selections (ranges of text), node
selections (single block nodes), or all-selections (entire document).
