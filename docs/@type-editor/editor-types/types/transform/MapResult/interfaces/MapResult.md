# Interface: MapResult

Defined in: [packages/editor-types/src/types/transform/MapResult.ts:18](https://github.com/type-editor/type/blob/e4864dcc638305a01de9e1948959c6e89a004528/packages/editor-types/src/types/transform/MapResult.ts#L18)

An object representing a mapped position with additional information about the mapping.

This interface provides detailed feedback about what happened to a position during mapping,
including whether content was deleted and recovery information for mirrored transformations.
It is returned by the `mapResult()` method of objects implementing the `Mappable` interface.

## Example

```typescript
const stepMap = new StepMap([2, 4, 0]); // Delete 4 characters at position 2
const result = stepMap.mapResult(4, 1);
console.log(result.pos); // Mapped position (2)
console.log(result.deleted); // true - position was deleted
console.log(result.deletedAcross); // true - deleted content spans across position
```

| <a id="property-deleted"></a> `deleted`             | `readonly` | `boolean` | Indicates whether the position was deleted during mapping. A position is considered deleted when it falls within a range that was completely replaced or removed by the transformation. The specific meaning depends on the `assoc` parameter: - When content on both sides is deleted, this is always `true` - When content on only one side is deleted, this is `true` only if `assoc` points toward the deleted content **Example** `const deleteMap = new StepMap([5, 10, 0]); // Delete 10 chars at position 5 deleteMap.mapResult(10, 1).deleted; // true - position was in deleted range deleteMap.mapResult(5, -1).deleted; // false - assoc points away from deletion` | [packages/editor-types/src/types/transform/MapResult.ts:66](https://github.com/type-editor/type/blob/e4864dcc638305a01de9e1948959c6e89a004528/packages/editor-types/src/types/transform/MapResult.ts#L66)   |
| <a id="property-deletedacross"></a> `deletedAcross` | `readonly` | `boolean` | Indicates whether the position was in the middle of deleted content. This is `true` when the position fell within a range that had content deleted on both sides of it (or the position itself was deleted). This indicates that the position was surrounded by a deletion, not just adjacent to one. **Example** `const deleteMap = new StepMap([0, 20, 0]); // Delete 20 chars at position 0 deleteMap.mapResult(10, 1).deletedAcross; // true - position in deleted range`                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [packages/editor-types/src/types/transform/MapResult.ts:111](https://github.com/type-editor/type/blob/e4864dcc638305a01de9e1948959c6e89a004528/packages/editor-types/src/types/transform/MapResult.ts#L111) |
| <a id="property-deletedafter"></a> `deletedAfter`   | `readonly` | `boolean` | Indicates whether content was deleted immediately after this position. This is `true` when a deletion occurred at or after the mapped position, affecting content that followed it. Useful for understanding the context of how the position was affected by transformations. **Example** `const deleteMap = new StepMap([5, 10, 0]); // Delete 10 chars at position 5 deleteMap.mapResult(5, -1).deletedAfter; // true - deletion after position`                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [packages/editor-types/src/types/transform/MapResult.ts:96](https://github.com/type-editor/type/blob/e4864dcc638305a01de9e1948959c6e89a004528/packages/editor-types/src/types/transform/MapResult.ts#L96)   |
| <a id="property-deletedbefore"></a> `deletedBefore` | `readonly` | `boolean` | Indicates whether content was deleted immediately before this position. This is `true` when a deletion occurred at or before the mapped position, affecting content that preceded it. Useful for understanding the context of how the position was affected by transformations. **Example** `const deleteMap = new StepMap([0, 5, 0]); // Delete 5 chars at position 0 deleteMap.mapResult(5, 1).deletedBefore; // true - deletion before position`                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [packages/editor-types/src/types/transform/MapResult.ts:81](https://github.com/type-editor/type/blob/e4864dcc638305a01de9e1948959c6e89a004528/packages/editor-types/src/types/transform/MapResult.ts#L81)   |
| <a id="property-delinfo"></a> `delInfo`             | `readonly` | `number`  | Bitwise flags indicating deletion information. This is a bitwise combination of `DeletionInfo` flags (BEFORE, AFTER, ACROSS, SIDE) that provide detailed information about how deletion affected this position. Use the boolean properties (`deleted`, `deletedBefore`, etc.) for easier access.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [packages/editor-types/src/types/transform/MapResult.ts:35](https://github.com/type-editor/type/blob/e4864dcc638305a01de9e1948959c6e89a004528/packages/editor-types/src/types/transform/MapResult.ts#L35)   |
| <a id="property-pos"></a> `pos`                     | `readonly` | `number`  | The mapped position after the transformation. This is the new position in the transformed document that corresponds to the original position. If the position was deleted, this will be the position where the deletion occurred.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [packages/editor-types/src/types/transform/MapResult.ts:26](https://github.com/type-editor/type/blob/e4864dcc638305a01de9e1948959c6e89a004528/packages/editor-types/src/types/transform/MapResult.ts#L26)   |
| <a id="property-recover"></a> `recover`             | `readonly` | `number`  | Recovery value for mapping through mirrored transformations, or `null`. When a position is deleted and a mirror relationship exists between steps, this value can be used to recover the position by mapping through the mirrored step. This is essential for collaborative editing and undo/redo functionality. If no recovery is possible or needed, this will be `null`. **See** Mapping.setMirror for establishing mirror relationships                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [packages/editor-types/src/types/transform/MapResult.ts:47](https://github.com/type-editor/type/blob/e4864dcc638305a01de9e1948959c6e89a004528/packages/editor-types/src/types/transform/MapResult.ts#L47)   |
