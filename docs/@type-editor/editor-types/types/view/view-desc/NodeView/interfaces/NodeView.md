# Interface: NodeView

Defined in: [packages/editor-types/src/types/view/view-desc/NodeView.ts:17](https://github.com/type-editor/type/blob/e4864dcc638305a01de9e1948959c6e89a004528/packages/editor-types/src/types/view/view-desc/NodeView.ts#L17)

By default, document nodes are rendered using the result of the
[`toDOM`](#model.NodeSpec.toDOM) method of their spec, and managed
entirely by the editor. For some use cases, such as embedded
node-specific editing interfaces, you want more control over
the behavior of a node's in-editor representation, and need to
[define](#view.EditorProps.nodeViews) a custom node view.

Objects returned as node views must conform to this interface.
