A description of a DOM structure. Can be either a string, which is
interpreted as a text node, a DOM node, which is interpreted as
itself, a `{dom, contentDOM}` object, or an array.

An array describes a DOM element. The first value in the array
should be a string—the name of the DOM element, optionally prefixed
by a namespace URL and a space. If the second element is plain
object, it is interpreted as a set of attributes for the element.
Any elements after that (including the 2nd if it's not an attribute
object) are interpreted as children of the DOM elements, and must
either be valid `DOMOutputSpec` values, or the number zero.

The number zero (pronounced "hole") is used to indicate the place
where a node's child nodes should be inserted. If it occurs in an
output spec, it should be the only child element in its parent
node.
