[AllSelection](classes/AllSelection.md)

</td>
<td>

A selection type that represents selecting the whole document
(which can not necessarily be expressed with a text selection, when
there are for example leaf block nodes at the start or end of the
document).

This selection type is useful when you need to select all content,
including non-inline elements that cannot be part of a text selection.
