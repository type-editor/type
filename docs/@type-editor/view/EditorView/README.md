An editor view manages the DOM structure that represents an
editable document. Its state and behavior are determined by its
[props](#view.DirectEditorProps).

The view is responsible for:

- Rendering the document state as DOM elements
- Handling user input and converting it to transactions
- Managing selections and keeping them in sync with the DOM
- Coordinating plugin views and custom node views
- Observing external DOM changes (composition, spellcheck, etc.)
