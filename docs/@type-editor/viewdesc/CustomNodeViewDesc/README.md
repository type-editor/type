A separate subclass is used for customized node views, so that the
extra checks only have to be made for nodes that are actually
customized.

Custom node views allow developers to override default rendering and
behavior for specific node types. This class delegates to the custom
spec methods (update, selectNode, setSelection, etc.) when available.
