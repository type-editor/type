A mark desc represents a mark. May have multiple children,
depending on how the mark is split. Note that marks are drawn using
a fixed nesting order, for simplicity and predictability, so in
some cases they will be split more often than would appear
necessary.

Marks wrap inline content to apply styling or semantic meaning (e.g., bold, italic, links).
A mark view desc can contain both text nodes and other mark view descs (for nested marks).
