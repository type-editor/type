This module provides functions for structural document transformations in ProseMirror.
It includes operations for:
- Lifting content out of wrapping nodes
- Wrapping content in new nodes
- Splitting nodes at various depths
- Joining adjacent nodes
- Changing block types

These functions form the basis for higher-level editing commands and are designed
to work with ProseMirror's document model and schema constraints.
